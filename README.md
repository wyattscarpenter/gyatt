# gyatt
possible home for my suite of git aliases OR, perhaps more usefully, a git ui that isn't bad if I ever make one of those

One of the weird things about github is that most of their values adds are things you could technically go in git repos already, like wikis and issue tracking. So, anyway, I'm thinking I could create a git tool that just does that stuff in git, maybe it could be in here as well (you could gyatt open an issue from the command line, etc).

This might finally implement something I've been thinking about which is the ability to mark git repos as COMPLETE within the software itself (this would show up in the status, and possibly also as a COMPLETE file). And maybe other statuses a project can have.
