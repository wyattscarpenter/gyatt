# gyatt
possible home for my suite of git aliases (I already have many of these) OR, perhaps more usefully, a git ui that isn't bad if I ever make one of those

One of the weird things about github is that most of their values adds are things you could technically do in git repos already, like wikis and issue tracking. So, anyway, I'm thinking I could create a git tool that just does that stuff in git, maybe it could be in here as well (you could gyatt open an issue from the command line, etc).

This might finally implement something I've been thinking about which is the ability to mark git repos as COMPLETE within the software itself (this would show up in the status, and possibly also as a COMPLETE file). And maybe other statuses a project can have.

My readme about this project should complain about git, its usability, its inability to handle large files, link to the handmade hero parody of git, caution against using git, say that I have mastered git but maybe you shouldn't, etc.

And remember the ancient wisdom: “a voluptuous charmer takes food; a scoundrel is cursed to dwell restlessly in strange places”.
