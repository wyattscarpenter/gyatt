# If you modify any of these lines (without making a pull request with the new changes to gyatt (or, I suppose, removing these comment lines so that this file no longer claims to be gyatt)), then for your own sake as well as mine I recommend you leave a comment by the option with YOUR NAME and why you've done what you've done. This will help you later if you need to locate problems.
# This file is alphabetized for quick reference (normal gitconfig files are not alphabetized — they are simply in whatever chronological order the options were set from the command line — but this one was written by hand, so I did alphabetize it). First by section, then within each section by each option. This means you will probably want to skip past the [alias] section at first to check out the options at the bottom, which are likely to be more important to you.
